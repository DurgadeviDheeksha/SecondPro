Ten Test Cases You Should Automate
1. Repetitive Test Runs
This is the golden rule. If the test run is repetitive, you should automate it. This will save your precious time and energy. In addition, if this is the test you assume that you will run frequently in the future, automating is a very good idea. You will have more accurate and precise results, each time.

2. High-Risk Test Cases
If the involved risk is high, you should automate that test case. Prioritize the test cases based on human error hazard potential.

3. Critical Parts of A Web Application
Automating critical parts of your web app is a smart idea. You want to avoid any possibility of man-made error and to be on the safe side. This is especially true for test cases that can jeopardize the whole web application.

4. Extensive Tests
Inputting lots of data can be exhausting. In addition, the chances of making a mistake during the manual testing increase. This is why test which implies large data sets are usually automated. Mainly, we refer to those test cases which require filling long forms.

5. Evaluate the Pros and Cons
By evaluation, we imply the time required to complete the automation process or to do the test manually. If you are not ready to invest time in the automation process, i.e. if the process itself would take more time than manual testing, common sense says that the automation is not worth it. This is especially true for non-repetitive tests.

6. Three Golden Tests
There are three test cases that you should not question when it comes to automation: the regression test, smoke test, and sanity test. Why? Because each build or release of the app requires testing.

To perform these tests, there are various tools available at your aid. You can utilize tools like LambdaTest which can help you test across 2,000+ browsers and operating system combinations. You can perform both manual and automation testing using LambdaTest.

7. If You Can Answer the Magical Question “Why?”
Don’t ever automate a test case just because you can. This could bring you more harm than good. If it will benefit the app, your team, or the organization, go ahead. Your goal should always be fast feedback, precision, and better overall results. However, don’t forget that Selenium requires deep knowledge when it comes to script writing.

Manual testing is sometimes a better option, especially if you are not a skilled Selenium user.

Remember that the answer to the question “Why?” when it comes to automation must never be “Because I can.”

8. Complex Cases
Automating complex test cases is almost a rule. Again, you do want to be on the safe side and to save your time when it comes to complexity.

9. Performance Testing
We usually choose to automate performance testing, such as load testing and stress testing.

10. Long Testing
If a case requires an overnight devotion, you should automate it.
